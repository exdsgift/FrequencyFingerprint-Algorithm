# Shazam Fingerprint Algorithm from scratch
Developing a simple prototype of Shazam in Python.

### Notebook structure
- fingerprint_algorithm.ipynb : notebook that contains the explanation and implementation of the algorithm to a theoretical case. 
- fpal_test : nootebook testing of the algorithm in a real situation, implementation of recorded audio files for fingerpirnt recognition.

### Folders and resorces
- genres_original : folder containing more than 1000 songs in .wav format. Unlabeled, they are solely and exclusively for testing the algorithm.
- converted : folder containing 22 labeled songs belonging to different genres. Use for practical testing of the algorithm.
- converted_memo : folder that contains .wav audio recordings (contain presence of noise).  Useful for testing the algorithm in non-ideal situations

### Sources and requirements
- requirements.py : easy install all the items usefull for this project
